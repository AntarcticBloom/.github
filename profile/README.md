# Proletarian Systems
A tech cooperative detangling capitalist institutions with software for people, not profit.

We're starting a technological arms race against systems that extract wealth from the working class, or perpetuate inaction around the impending inhospitability of our planet. We're unionizing the tech workforce and empowering other industries to unionize. We're building and collectively owning the technological means of production. 

<!-- ## We need you! 🫵
Whatever your industry, your expertise *is* valuable.  -->

### About the logo
Inspired by the Denver Socialists of America rose, roses symbolize the promise of a better life than the one we presently have under capitalism. 

Just like their technology underlies the capitalist institutions lording over us today, ours underpins the institutions we'll need to organize, unionize, collectively bargain, decentralize, distribute, cooperate, and vote.
